Just like lawyers
-----------------
According to Peter Drucker we are all becoming "knowledge workers" - using our brains not our brawn to manipulate and improve our world.  Well the original knowledge workers may or may not agree.  Cast your minds back, back into the reaches of time, say to the court of the Pharoahs.  

The all powerful pharoah has had enough. Rameses the Unlikely Cockney III makes his voice ring out around the pyramids. 

  """I send out my decrees, my word is like that of the gods, but by the time it gets to the other side of my empire the bloody word is mangled and misinterpreted,  its like Chinese whispers around here. Oi you - scribe. I've got an idea. Write down my next decree then my soldiers can take that piece of parchment over to the other side of the empire and your mate can read it out - that way no bugger can conveniently "misunderstand me" - OK? """

And lo, the Pharoahs word was written down, and his decrees were like the word of the gods. 

  """ we need a good name for this system scribe. what shall we call it? Lawrence. Cant call it Lawrence - silly name. SHortend it. Call it, rence. OK? No. Thats no good. Lawren? Law?"""

And so the scribe writes down his masters words, but over time Rameses the Cockney makes so many pronouncements, that even he forgets what he was on about, and the scribe must refer back, to different and probably conflicting pronouncements. And the scribe must then interpret the law, because obviously Rameses did not mean to contradict himself.

And the written word starts to take on more importance than the actual Rameses. I mean he cant be everywhere pronouncing on every little thing can he?  So people read what he said, and work on that basis. 

And some societies thrive, and some, their laws unsuitable or unchanging do not thrive.

And then someone invents a new way to write things down, a new means called programming. And society suddenly has a new way to define how it wants to run its own affairs. 

And those who wrote things down, become those who can interpret what was written down. The scribes become the lawyers, arguing over precise defintions of piddling little words, whilst trying to recognise that sometimes their writings can affect millions.

Its a bit like programmers arguing over a little bug in a million lines of source code, whilst trying to remember the code is for a missile, a power plant a banking risk manager.

In fact its a lot like it ...
