What is an IT Manager / CIO / CTO / ..?
=======================================
In many ways this heading is the problem - what the hell do you call an IT manager.
Looking at job adverts it is easy to see a creeping job-title inflation. 

For the UK now, the term *IT Manager* seems to be reserved for the person in charge of the helpdesk
fixing the printers and so forth. Whilst for some companies this is a role with supervision over
dozens of people, it still is just supervision. *Head of IT* seems to be becoming an accepted title for what I mean
- as is *CTO* or *CIO*. These job descriptions indicate that the important point is you are in charge of all the IT stuff for the company. 



Cook well on your own
---------------------

Well, firstly there needs to be ability. Technical skills are the bottom line, no matter what else is waved around, 
technical ability is vital. It is not that we expect the CIO to write all the code or configure all the
databases. But we do expect them to set the standards, spot the glaring design faults and ensure that
what is produced is the best quality we are willing to pay for.  

An example that recently made my blood boil was a job ad for 'Head of IT', which clearly stated::

  A non-technical background is not considered a barrier, as there are 3rd party providers who 
  can supply technical assistance. 

Dear God, thats not "Head of IT". Thats a supervisior. At 80K a year.  I mean would we accept a job that ran ::

  Wanted - Head Chef. No need to able to cook, as the providers of frozen processed foods
  will be able to supply all assitance necessary.

Well actually we do get quite a few adverts like that - they explain the parlous state of our childrens
school meals, which have moved from something actually prepared and cooked on site to, well, Turkey Twizzlers.

And lets face it, the company above (a law firm of some sort) will get the same kind of nutritious and profitable IT systems as the patrons of the restaurant above will get as meals. All the value of a frozen breadcrumbed reconsititued chicken. And yet, yet look at the salary. It is based at 80K, a clear indication that the partners expect something special, something nutirtious and tasty from their 'Head of IT'.  They are willing to accept a dinner lady, but pay for Gordon Ramsey. I wonder which they are mostl likey to get applying?

so the first line of the job ad should read ::

  wanted: Head Chef. As a *sine qua non* You must be able to cook well 
  on your own. 

This really emphaisises the most obvious point about IT management and one that I feel is ignored and even quite 
controversial when I state it - A good IT manager should be able to do every job under him.  For me the simple answer
is that the IT manager should be able to run a small office (say 3-5 people) entirely on his own. This is the equivalent of
asking, if I hire Gordon Ramsey as a cook for my family (yeah, right!) will he be able to shop and cook from scratch all alone?

For Gordon we can happily say yes.  At that point we can worry if he can scale it up to a restaurant or a chain.  A diffeent set of skills that Gordon does have, and frankly half this site is dedicated to.

For an IT manager, we need to ask, can he set up and run all the email, web, printers and so forth for a 1 or 2 person office? If not, then on what basis do we think they can scale up?

The Head chef sets the tone of a kitchen, sets the standards, and is the gateway through which all finished products must pass.  He can only do this if he knows what good fresh pasta looks like and what is needed to prepare it. 

In short you need a boss who can do the job he is in charge of.  You won't hire a newspaper editor who cannot write, you won't hire a chef who cannot cook.  So why hire an IT manager who cannot program?

And to me that is the clincher, whatever the job titles, whatever the description, the person who makes
the final, *informed* decision about the architecture of information data and code in an organisation is that
company's IT Manager. It might be the helpdesk supervisor, it might be the accountant, but ultimately
someone will decide how all the systems in a company fit together, work together and share information 
and share functions. Sometimes, quite often I suspect, the person who is the IT manager for a company is not even in the company.  f we are looking for the final, *informed* decision maker - it is perfectly possible for that person to be a consultant hired by the nominally titled IT Manager, but that IT manager is not skilled enough to make IT decisions on their own. Frankly you need to be able to program before you can really be in the industry [#]_. And many many people who cannot program are in IT. Its like having someone in catering who cannot cook. The only job there is maitre'd.



.. sidebar:: No Decision here 

  Not actually having a final informed decision maker in the company seems to be getting more common, not less common.
  It is also one of the reasons I recommend OSS over microsoft. It is not some irrational hatred of the big bad Redmound
  but is a desire to see people take positive decisions over systems integration.  Many years ago the default  
  non-decision would leave a company with two systems that could not communicate, and so lead to the 
  *systems integrators* compnaies and consultants whose sole purpose was to come in and make the new system 
  work with the legacy computers, usually in a way that blames the old legacy computer, not the person who bought 
  an incompatible system in the first place.
  However now it is easier and easier to buy Microsoft (or SAP or Oracle) and things do not break, they more or less work,  more or less well. However all that has happened is that Microsoft has chosen what they think is the best way 
  for your systems to work. Is it? Are you sure you do not want to think about that?


The section of the book entitled *SoHo Solo* is about how to actually do this - to run a small office / home office (SoHo) as if you were on your own - from the initial setup of servers, to DNS, email virus scanning and database management.
It is quite a tall order, but then let us face it, buying quality fresh foods and knowing how to boil a lobster, make fresh pasta and raise a souffle is quite a tall order too.  That's why Head Chefs get paid well, and why dinner ladies don't.
