A Joule is the international unit of energy.
A watt is the international unit of power.
A watt is a measure of energy *flow*. That is a watt is a flow of energy 
(lets say out of the wall socket, into your lamp) of 1 Joule per second.

One joule is approximately 1% of a peanut. This is a tiny amount.  Honestly. A more useful and commonly used amount of energy is the kilowatt-hour.


A kilowatt is a thousand Joules per second.
So a Kilowatt hour, is a thousand Joules per second flowing out of a wall socket over the course of an hour. Into our big bag of energy would come 

  1000 x 60 x 60 

  or

  3,600,000 Joules


Now a Joule = Calorie. Yes thats right, the maazine cover diet style of calorie. Except that every time you hear the word calorie in a diet related sense, it is used wrong - 1,000 times wrong. THe calorie you need to cut out in a diet is actally a kil-calorie. I have no idea why it got confused but there you are, it did. 

So my wife's glossy tells me I need to eat only 2,500 calories a day or so. Which really means 2,500,000 Joules.
Now I can easily scoff more than that, and with (a lot less ease) burn that up. A days hard hiking, or a job on a building site will probably use 3,600 calories a day. 

SO we have a useful, human sized, measure of a "bag" of energy - a kWh.  Its easy to calculate (its about the energy used
leaving a bar fire or a kettle on for an hour, its also the energy used by working hard for a day - perhaps getting a servant)


So a kilowatt-hour is *not* a thousand watts per hour, or any other measure of flow. A kilowatt-hour is a bag of energy that is about the amount of work you could do in a day, and feel knackered at the end.
