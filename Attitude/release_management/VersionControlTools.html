<td colspan="4">
<p></p>
<p>If you spend time talking to software developers about tools, one
  of the biggest topics I hear about are version control tools. Once
  you've got to the point of using version control tools, and any
  competent developers does, then they become a big part of your
  life. Version tools are not just important for maintaining a history
  of a project, they are also the foundation for a team to
  collaborate. So it's no surprise that I hear frequent complaints
  about poor version control tools. In our recent <a href="https://www1.vtrenz.net/imarkownerfiles/ownerassets/1013/Technology%20Radar%20Jan%202010.pdf">ThoughtWorks
  technology radar</a>, we called out two items as version control
  tools that enterprises should be assessing for use: Subversion and
  Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). Here I want to expand on
  that, summarizing many discussions we've had internally about
  version control tools.</p><img src="VersionControlTools_files/vcs-plane.png"><p>But first some pinches of salt. I wrote this piece based on an
  unscientific agglomeration of conversations with my colleagues
  inside ThoughtWorks and various friends and associates outside. I
  haven't engaged in any rigorous testing or structured comparisons,
  so like most of my writing this is based on
  <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnecdotalEvidence.html">AnecdotalEvidence</a>. My personal experience in recent years
  is mostly subversion and mercurial, but my usage patterns are not
  typical of a software development team. Overwhelmingly my contacts
  like to work in an agile-xp approach (even if many sniff at the
  label) and need tools that support that work style. I expect many
  people to be annoyed by this article. I hope that annoyance will
  lead to good articles that I can link to.</p><p>Fundamentally there's three version control systems that get
  broad approval: <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> (svn), <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">mercurial</a> (hg).</p>
<h3>Behind the Recommendability Threshold</h3>
<p>Many tools fail to pass the recommendability threshold. There are two
  reasons why: poor capability or poor visibility.</p><p>Many tools garner consistent complaints from ThoughtWorkers about
  their lack of capability. (ThoughtWorkers being what they are, all
  tools, including the preferred set, get some complaints. Those
  behind the threshold get <i>mostly</i> complaints.) Two in particular
  generate a lot of criticism: <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase/">ClearCase</a>
  (from IBM) and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/dd408382.aspx">TFS</a>
  (from Microsoft). One reason they get a lot of criticism is that
  they are very popular on client sites, often with company policies
  mandating their use (I'll describe a coping strategy for that
  at the end).</p><p>It's fair to say that often these problems are compounded by
  company policies around using VCS. I've heard of some truly bizarre
  work-flows imposed on teams that make it a constant hurdle to get
  anything done. Since the VCS is the tool that enforces these
  work-flows, it does tend to get tarred with that brush.</p><p>I'm not going to go into details about the problems the
  poor-capability tools have here, that would be another
  article. (This has probably made me even more unpopular in IBM and
  Microsoft as it is.) I will, at least for the moment, leave it with
  the fact that developers I respect have worked extensively with, and
  do not recommend, these products.</p><p>The second reason for shuffling a tool behind the
  recommendability threshold is that I don't hear many comments about
  some tools. This is an issue because less-popular tools make it
  difficult to find developers who know how to use them or want to
  find out. There are many reasons why otherwise good tools can fall
  behind there. I used to hear people say good things about Perforce,
  but now the feeling seems to be that it doesn't have compelling
  advantages over Subversion, let alone the DVCSs. Speaking of DVCSs,
  there are more than just the two I've highlighted here. Bazaar, in
  particular, is one I occasionally hear good things about, but again
  I hear about it much less often then git or Mercurial.</p><p>Before I finish with those behind the threshold, I just want to
  say a few things about  a particularly awful
  tool: Visual Source Safe, or as I call it: Visual Source
  Shredder. We see this less often now, thank goodness, but if you are
  using it we'd strongly suggest you get off it. Now. Not just is it a
  pain to use, I've heard too many tales of repository corruption to
  trust it with anything more valuable than foo.txt.</p><p>So this leaves three tools that my contacts are generally happy
  with. I find it interesting that all three are open-source. Choosing
  between these tools involves first deciding between a centralized or
  distributed VCS model and then, if you chose DVCS, choosing between
  git and mercurial.</p>
<h3>Distributed or Centralized</h3>
<p>Most of the time, the choice between centralized and distributed
  rests on how skilled and disciplined the development team is. A
  distributed system opens up lots of flexibility in work-flow, but
  that flexibility can be dangerous if you don't have the maturity to
  use it well. Subversion encourages a simple central repository
  model, discouraging large scale branching. In an environment that's
  using <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous
  Integration</a>, which is how most of my friends like to work, that
  model fits reasonably well. As a result Subversion is a good choice
  for most environments.</p><p>And although DVCSs give you lots of flexibility in how you
  arrange your work-flows, most people I know still base their work
  patterns on the notion of a shared mainline repository that's used
  with Continuous Integration. Although modern VCS have almost magic
  tools to merge different people's changes, these merges are still
  just merging text. Continuous Integration is still necessary to get
  semantic consistency. So as a result even a team using DVCS usually
  still has the notion of the central master repository.</p><p>Subversion has three main downsides compared to its cooler
  distributed cousins.</p><p>Because distributed systems always give you a local disk copy of
  the whole repository, this means that repository operations are
  always fast as they don't involve network calls to central
  servers. This is a palpable difference if you are looking at logs,
  diffing to old revisions, and anything else that involves the full
  repository. If this is noticeable on my home network, it is a huge
  issue if your repository is on another continent - as we find with
  our distributed projects.</p><p>If you travel away from your network connection to the
  repository, a distributed system will still allow you to work with
  the repository. You can commit checkpoints of your work, browse
  history, and compare revisions on an airplane without a network
  connection.</p><p>The last downside is more of a social issue than a true tool
  issue. DVCS encourages quick branching for experimentation. You can
  do branches in Subversion, but the fact that they are visible to all
  discourages people from opening up a branch for experimental
  work. Similarly a DVCS encourages check-pointing of work: committing
  incomplete changes, that may not even compile or pass tests, to your local
  repository. Again you could do this on a developer branch in
  Subversion, but the fact that such branches are in the shared space
  makes people less likely to do so.</p><p>This last point also leads to the argument against a DVCS, that
  it encourages wanton branching, that feels good early on but can
  easily lead you to merge doom. In particular the
  <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html">FeatureBranch</a> approach is a popular one that I don't
  encourage. As with similar comments earlier I must point out that
  reckless branching isn't something that's particular to one
  tool. I've often heard people in ClearCase
  environments complain of the same issue. But DVCSs encourage
  branching, and that's the major reason why I indicate that team
  needs more skill to use a DVCS well.</p><p>There is one particular case where subversion is the better
  choice even for a team that skilled at using a DVCS. This case is
  where the artifacts you're collaborating on are binary and cannot be
  merged by the VCS - for example word documents or presentation
  decks. In this case you need to revert to pessimistic locking with
  single-writer checkouts - and that requires a centralized
  system.</p>
<h3>Git or Mercurial</h3>
<p>So if you're going to go the DVCS route - which one should you
  choose? Mercurial and git get most of the attention, so I feel the
  choice is between them. Then the choice boils down to power versus
  usability, with a dash of mind-share and the shadow of github.</p><p>Git certainly seems to be liked for its power. Folks go ga-ga
  over it's near-magical ability to do textual merges automatically
  and correctly, even in the face of file renames. I haven't seen any
  objective tests comparing merge capabilities, but the subjective
  opinion favors git.</p><p>(<a href="http://lucas-ward.blogspot.com/2010/02/maturity-model-for-source-control-scmm.html">Merge-through-rename</a>,
  as my colleague Lucas Ward defines it, describes the following scenario. I
  rename Foo.cs to Bar.cs, Lucas makes some changes to Foo.cs. When we
  merge his changes are correctly applied to Bar.cs. Both git and
  Mercurial handle this.)</p><p>For many git's biggest downside was its oft-cryptic commands and
  mental model. Ben Butler-Cole phrased it beautifully: "there is this
  amazingly powerful thing writhing around in there that will
  basically do everything I could possibly ask of it if only I knew
  how." To its detractors, git lacks discoverability - the ability to
  gradual infer what it does from it's apparent design. Git's
  advocates say that much of this is because it uses a different
  mental model to other VCSs, so you have to do more unlearn your
  knowledge of VCS to appreciate git. Whatever the reason git seems to
  be attractive more to those who enjoy learning the internals while
  mercurial seems to appeal more to those who just want to do version
  control.</p><p>The shadow of github is important here. Even git-skeptics rate it
  as a superb place for project collaboration. Mercurial's equivalent,
  <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a>, just doesn't
  inspire the same affection. However there are other sites that may
  begin to close the gap, in particular <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> and Microsoft's <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a>. (I find Codeplex's use of
  Mercurial very encouraging. Microsoft is often, rightly, criticized
  for not collaborating well with complementary open source
  products. Their use of Mercurial on their open-source hosting site
  is a very encouraging sign.)</p><p>Historically git worked poorly on Windows, poorly enough that
  we'd not suggest it. This has now changed, providing you run it using
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a> and not
  cygwin. Our view now is that msysgit is good enough to make
  comparison with Mercurial a non-issue for Windows.</p><p>People generally find that git handles branching better than
  Mercurial, particular for short-lived branches for experimentation
  and check-pointing. Mercurial encourages other mechanisms, such as
  fast cloning of separate repository directories and queue patching,
  but git's branching is a simpler and better model.</p><p>Mercurial does seem to have an issue with large binary files. My
  general suggestion is that such things are usually better managed
  with subversion, but if you have too few of them to warrant separate
  management, then Mercurial may get hung up by the few that you have.</p>
<h3>Multiple VCS</h3>
<p>There's often value to using more than one VCS at the same
  time. This is generally where there is a wider need to use a less
  capable VCS than your team wants to use.</p><p>The case that we run into frequently is where there is a
  corporate standard for a deficient VCS (usually ClearCase) but we
  wish to work efficiently. In that case we've had success using a
  different VCS for day-to-day team team work and committing to the
  corporate VCS when necessary. So while the team VCS will see
  several commits per person per day, the corporate VCS sees a 
  commit every week or two. Often that's what the corporate admins
  prefer in any case. Historically we've done this using svn as the
  local VCS but in the future we're more likely to use a DVCS for
  local fronting.</p><p>This dual usage scenario is also common with git-svn where people
  use git locally but commit to a shared svn system. Git-svn is another
  reason for preferring git over mercurial. Using a local DVCS is
  particularly valuable for remote site working, where network outages
  and bandwidth problems can cripple a site that's remote from a
  centralized VCS.</p><p>A lot of teams can benefit from this dual-VCS working style,
  particularly if there's a lot of corporate ceremony enforced by
  their corporate VCS. Using dual-VCS can often make both the local
  development team happier and the corporate controllers happier as
  their motivations for VCS are often different.</p>
<h3>One Final Note</h3>
<p>Remember that although I've jabbered on a lot about tools here,
  often its the practices and workflows that make a bigger
  difference. Tools can certainly make it much easier to use a good
  set of practices, but in the end it's up to the people to use an
  effective way of working for their environment. I like to see
  approaches that allow many small changes that are rapidly integrated
  using Continuous Integration. I'd rather use a poor tool with CI
  than a good tool without.</p><hr></td>
