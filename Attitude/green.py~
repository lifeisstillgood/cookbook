A Joule is the international unit of energy.
A watt is the international unit of power.
A watt is a measure of energy *flow*. That is a watt is a flow of energy 
(lets say out of the wall socket, into your lamp) of 1 Joule per second.

One joule is approximately 1% of a peanut. This is a tiny amount.  Honestly. A more useful and commonly used amount of energy is the kilowatt-hour.


A kilowatt is a thousand Joules per second.
So a Kilowatt hour, is a thousand Joules per second flowing out of a wall socket over the course of an hour. Into our big bag of energy would come 

  1000 x 60 x 60 

  or

  3,600,000 Joules



A more useful amount is the energy a human can output over the course of a day 
- much more understandable.

A human working hard 


So a kilowatt-hour is *not* a thousand watts per hour, or any other measure of flow. A kilowatt-hour is a bag of energy that is about the amount of work you could do in a day, and feel knackered at the end.
