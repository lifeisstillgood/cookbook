==================

There are three main connected areas of the book

- Philosophy (or opinionated rants)
  a great deal of good IT management is making decisions in situations of limited information. in such situations
  a strong coherent thread of explanation is very useful.  I may not have all the facts but the best approach is usually ...
  perhaps we could call this heuristics.

- SoHo-solo. This is the traditional computer how-to section, with lots of configuring computer systems.
  Elsewhere I liken this to ensuring that your head chef is able to cook well at home first.
  If an IT manager is not able to run a relatively simple but complete set up first then, like a head chef 
  why do we think he can run a busy restaurant ?

- deeper meat
  this is discussing the sort of situations we only get when actually trying to run the restaurant,
  I learnt to cook a risotto from a Jamie Oliver cookbook, which was fine, but it would take ages, slowly softening the rice then adding the ingredients. THen I started reading more widely (as well as trying differing quality risotto in differing quality restaurants). FOr the life of me I could not figure out how restaurants could prepare me a risotto in ten minutes - it took me an hour standing over the pot. And then I found the trick. what you do is you cook a large amount of arboritto rice as a base and as it reaches al-dente take it off the heat and cool it, store it in the frige and there is a base that you can whip out and throw into a pan add a little stock and then muchrooms or asparagus or whatever.

  There are a lot of similar tricks in IT management. THings that even with the base skills of cookery are not cleanly obvious. Just dont order fish on a monday.
