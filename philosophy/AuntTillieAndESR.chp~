the basic argument is simple - things should be simple enough for an inteligent technical user to use and understand./
Not for AUnt tillie, but for ESR

Its to do with unfolding I think.
A jopurney an intelligent programmer must take to get to usability and mastery 
- no wrong directions. No if you di this for while but then we teach you something else
- it must be transparent - the inner workings of a watch are clear - it has gears.  You do not need to know the fantastic complexity 
but you also do not need to think its all done by swans.

I agree with the basics - that functional software is one thing,
but good UI, functional discoverable software is another order of magnitude.

THis is the internal shoip dilemma - your users are going to be forced to use the software so good UI is worth less than creatring another piece of function
