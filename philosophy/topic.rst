A philosophy of IT Management
=============================

You cannot do it all yourself.  So you need to delegate.  And that means having a
*vision*.  Well, actually I have an innate distrust of the usefulness of inspiring
visions to do anything much more than inspire.  Steve Jobs may have had a vision,
but it was the day-to-day actions that pushed his philosophy onto Apple.  Maybe, I wasn't there.
