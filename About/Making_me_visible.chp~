Towards a visible IT manager
============================


I might not be a great programmer, if I was I am sure I would have noticed by now.  I am a pretty good one, when I give myself the time to sit down and work

So there are three areas

- giving myself time
- choosing the best 'strategy'
- working with best people

first one only I can sort out
the second and third are what this article is about.

Strategy
--------
CHoosing the best frameworks to work within - its all about choosing your constraints
Even this website is a constraint - but a valuable one. I get to record my thoughts but do so in way with one eye on someone reading it and needing to understand me - so I put a bit more effort into comprehension.  And later on I can understand what I meant.

Open source
-----------
Getting to work with the best is hard - often we are thrown together in a company and whomever we work with we are stuck with.  A feeling people who ended up next to me are familar with!
However Open source is much more ... open.  We should all be working in the project based model - and we should all be building an online reputation. 


Articles and PR 
Speaking engagements
Open source tools
Website writing







OpenSource ERP
OpenSource CIOtools


CIOtools
--------
COllection of tools that I think are useful for 


I want to be in a position where I can publically demonstrate my skills, experience, understanding and philiosophy of IT management
That is best done through a website / semi blog, preferably with speaking, books or so foth if feasible
I would like that to tie into job hunt.

Write the web site
------------------
My overview

- how-to, why-to and bad jokes too.

how-to
------
What is IT mgmt

- sysadmin
- project mgmt
- operations mgmt
- change mgmt. tranformational work (see olaf)
- software development
- business admin (PO and assets, invoice, accounts, HR)
-

Towards open source ERP, that is ERP that you can damn well understand
The idea is to release not perfect poliched work, but to release work that is an explanation,
and that a programmer can take and add to their own needs.
This is philosophy of releasing work - it is also good for a lazy person.

Open source is an explanation
Software is a representation of human thinking in code form, so it should be understandable
We are representing the company and how it thinks in code. So it should not be confusing, or hidden
