Who is Paul Brian?

International Man of Mystery?
=============================

Well, probably not.

I am a programmer at heart (see `my github profile <https://github.com/lifeisstillgood>`_), but took the money and went into management.::

    A developer.

    Then led teams of developers.

    Then led IT departments, building PIRC up from rubble into a team capable of taking on billion dollar competitors.

    Now teaching others how to build not just agile software development teams, but complete Agile IT departments, from idea to release.

    Specialties

    Drawing clover leaf on top of a pint of Guiness.
    Its a skill that never left me.
