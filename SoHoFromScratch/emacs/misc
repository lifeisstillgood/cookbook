To be slightly shorter than those guys, the variable window-system is something if you're in a window-system, and nil if you're in a terminal, So if i wanted to load color-theme-darkblue2 i would have:

(if window-system
    (progn
       (load "color-theme")
       (color-theme-darkblue2)))

and it will just use the default colors in the terminal. Of course, you could obviously load a term-friendly theme in the else-part if you wanted to:

(load "color-theme")
(if window-system
     (color-theme-darkblue2)
   (some-term-theme)))
