One should keep a notebook for those oddities that oneday may prove useful

1. Installing org-mode in emacs::
  
   # Name of your emacs binary
   EMACS=emacs

   # Where local software is found
   prefix=/usr/local

   # Where local lisp files go.
   lispdir = $(prefix)/share/emacs/site-lisp
   #thirdparty lisp files it seems

   # Where info files go.
   infodir = $(prefix)/info
   #info files for the gnu-help

   THEN 

   make install
