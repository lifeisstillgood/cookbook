What needs to be on your laptop and why
=======================================

Our personal productive space is vital.  I cover `personal productivity <../philosophy/productivity.html>`_ 
elsewhere.  But what is on our laptops, and how well we use it is also a driving force
in how much we can do (its not about doing a little more in 8 hours, its about doing
a lot more, in minutes).
