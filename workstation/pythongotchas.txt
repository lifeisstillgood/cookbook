cPickle and storing objects
The object stores the ref in which it was working
::

 p2
 ccopy_reg
 _reconstructor
 p3
 (cscanning_app.model.accounts_images
 ScanImage
 p4
 c__builtin__
 object
 p5
 NtRp6
 (dp7


vs

p2
ccopy_reg
_reconstructor
p3
(c__main__
ScanImage
p4


so if I store in one context, ie __main__, and open in another ie webserver
it will force back the original context, find nothing in __main__ and die
