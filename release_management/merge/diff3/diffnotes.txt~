Merging and Diffing
===================

Control over the released code.  This is one of the prime jobs of the IT Manager.

It requires a solid but well understood process, a strong understanding of merging and diffing and lots of automated tests

Merging and diffing
===================

The essential question is how do I convert file 1 into file 2 ?

start with two files

::

  mine          older
   
  A             A
  B             C 
  C             F

We shall cover 2 way diffs first.  Do not worry why the files are named mine and older.  It will become clear.

::

  diff mine older

  2d1
  < B
  3a3
  > F

So, err, what does that mean?

In general the line 2d1 is a *change command*.  It has a rough form of <lines in file 1><command><lines in file 2>.
So the first part is line 2 in file 1, delete, (it owuld have been in line 1 of file 2 if we were not deleting it)

Huh?

Well, to convert ABC to ACF we need to bring C up one line. So we need to delete B, which if it was in Older, would now cover line 1 if we slid C up.  See?

OK, next.

Line 3 from file 1 needs to be added to line 3 of file 2.

And yes, that is how to convert ABC to ACF
