The most important part of Agile
================================

It seems that half the companies in the country are running agile projects,
so why is there still a recession on?

If there was one prescription, one simple measure for company agility is releasing to live.  Newpapers publish, actors perform, real programmers ship.

Amazingly this is a contentious view

I think it derives from the fact it is asking everyone, not just IT to change.
